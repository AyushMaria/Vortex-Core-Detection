# Vortex-Detection
Vortex Cores Detection Using Bagging and Boosting Algorithms 

I obtained image features in a csv file from the Yolo Algorithm.
I visualized these features using different plotting techniques through plotly.
Furthermore, I pass these features into Ensemble Models like Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier to predict the Vortex Cores.
